      <p>
        We are all searching for some kind of signal, whether that is a
        bird-like chorus wave out in deep space, an extraterrestrial response to
        the ‘Teen Age Message’ theremin concert in Moscow, or a NOAA signal
        detected from an open source software and a budget antenna. When I
        experienced the latter, my hairs stood up, and I smiled at my body's
        reaction to what, if decontextualized, seems like a mundane, everyday
        sound, a repetitive and irritating beep. To me, that beep was my portal
        into the cosmos, into the unknown. Less than a year ago, I wouldn’t have
        paid attention to this sound, but this project has taught me to open my
        ears to the channels of the nonhuman world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I’m reminded that this buzz might not last. This portal into the sky
        could be sealed in months, even days, in this age of increased
        censorship. CubicSDR could get shut down. Radio amateurs could be
        branded domestic terrorists. The signals could shift to inaudible
        frequencies. The great silence could become more deafening.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        And yet, if that happens, I know people would resist. Situated knowledge
        will always be appreciated more than state control, and communities like
        Open Weather will keep going, or new ones will pop up. Radio will
        continue to be a medium of hidden communication, even in the face of
        totalitarianism.
      </p>

        I’ve learned so much from this project - about nonhuman sound ecologies,
        electronic composition, biomimicry, feminist data collection, how to
        play a theremin, how to be a radio amateur, how to build a satellite
        ground station, how to subvert technologies from their military origins.
        I’ve learnt that murmurations sound like static, deep space sound waves
        sound like chirping birds, and that theremins can be used for ET
        communication (although we are still waiting for a response…) What a
        wonderful rabbit hole of information I have fallen into!
      </p>

        This has definitely been the most challenging technical and conceptual
        project I’ve done yet. Technically, because picking up the NOAA signals
        required exactness, and I struggled many nights to record anything
        audible due to my setup being slightly wrong. Also, I was using
        softwares that I had never heard of, so integrating them together was
        difficult, like learning a new language. I suppose in this way, I was
        learning the language of the radio and the theremin - of the nonhuman
        network. I also struggled to execute this project as one artist - I only
        have so many hands - and this project required tentacles to record,
        modulate, and pickup sounds. There would be moments in my experimenting
        where I would be trying to record footage, play the theremin, stick my
        antenna up in the air, integrate max and cubicSDR together, project onto
        satellites, all at the same time on my cold and windy roof. In these
        moments I craved collaborators, and will definitely find some when I
        develop this work further.

        Conceptually, the project was challenging because my subject matter
        would expand every week, and I would shift my focus on a new element of
        the story. This meant that it never got boring, but I would often have
        to remind myself exactly what I was trying to communicate - because I
        was trying to say so many different things. Which is why the project
        works better as a series of vignettes rather than one single product.
      </p>

        This work has informed my artistic practice to be more centered around
        sound design, electronic composition, cybernetics, and the nonhuman. I
        would like to develop my own deep listening practice, as inspired by
        Pauline Oliveros and other wise souls. Deep listening is more than just
        an aural act, but a way to appreciate that all things are delicately
        interconnected.
      </p>

        It feels like I’ve only just scratched the surface, and that there is so
        much potential to develop this project for years to come. Its
        exploration of the tension between the human and nonhuman, the
        biological and technological, is one that will shift seismically,
        becoming even more complex and entangled.

        I owe it all to the birds that sing like chainsaws, the satellites that
        swarm like starlings, the wings that flap like static, the signals that
        sound like the dawn chorus, the drone that mimics the sparrow, the
        starlings that trip the telephone wires, and so on and so forth…
