        ‘When Satellites Murmur’ is an ode to murmuration - the result of sonic
        experimentation between satellites, starlings, theremins, and (least
        importantly) humans. Murmuration as the sound made by thousands of
        starlings flapping their wings in unison, but more widely defined as the
        utterance of a low and continuous sound. In this paper, murmuration
        represents the ephemeral and at times incomprehensible channels of
        nonhuman vocalization. The work translates and modulates real-time and
        prerecorded signals between satellites and theremins, positioning their
        antennas not as passive receivers but as active listeners and
        instruments.

        This is an invitation to decenter human perception and acknowledge that
        most nonhuman entities—whether biological or technological—communicate
        through sensory modalities we can never fully access, but can only
        attempt to translate or understand.

        I am writing this paper in the US in 2025, where satellite technology
        has been developed by SpaceX to create a network of global surveillance
        for the US government, under the guise of achieving global connectivity
        for its customers. To make matters worse, the new Trump administration
        is simultaneously undermining the use of satellite technology for
        scientific research; for instance, imposing cuts on the National Oceanic
        and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which uses satellites to predict
        weather data.

        And yet, despite these technopolitics, we are still captivated by the
        dawn chorus, by mysterious satellite signals, by aerial murmurs of both
        the natural and artificial kind. The ephemerality of our cosmic
        soundscape is a lesson in deep listening, a chance to liberate
        technologies like radio and satellites from their military origins, and
        to repurpose them to celebrate the wonders of the nonhuman world. What
        sonic communication can be imagined between satellites, birds, and
        humans - one of harmony or interference?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        ‘When Satellites Murmur’ explores this tension between the poetics of
        nonhuman listening and the politics of communication technology. The
        first section of the paper provides context for this exploration through
        the history of satellites, the relationship between satellites and their
        avian counterparts - starlings - and the world of deep listening and
        software defined radio. The second section documents my process of
        building a network between satellites, radio, theremins, and birds for
        my final installation.

        This paper offers a momentary portal into the weird and wonderful world
        of the sky and its nonhuman networks.
