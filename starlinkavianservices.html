          “July 2025. SpaceX headquarters. Mr Musk has just unveiled his most
          ambitious idea yet - Starlink Avian Services, the first satellite
          service in existence marketed just for birds. Although SpaceX has
          generated $10 billion in profit in just this year alone, Mr Musk wants
          to expand the service to an interspecies audience in a connectivity
          revolution.”
