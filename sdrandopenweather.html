      <h1>Software Defined Radio</h1>

      <p></p>
      <p class="full-indent">
        Much like satellites, radio is deeply embedded in the foundation of
        military communications, enabling operators to respond to a wide range
        of shifting protocols in real time. A particularly intriguing example of
        this is the history of number stations, which first emerged during World
        War I as a method of encrypted signaling via shortwave transmission.
        These cryptic broadcasts, often delivered by a chilling, monotone voice
        - frequently female - reciting seemingly random numbers, were then
        decrypted using techniques like the One-Time Pad, facilitating
        international communication between intelligence agencies.

        While traditional radios tune into specific frequency bands, the birth
        of software-defined radio (SDR) allowed for more flexible modulation
        between frequencies and communication protocols, paving the way for
        richer experimentation. To its credit, SDR has made the often arcane
        world of radio more accessible and open-source to people who are
        interested in tuning in - which has encouraged a wave of radio amateurs
        to buy an antenna dongle kit, download software such as CubicSDR, and
        receive whichever frequency their heart so desires (in my case, between
        500 kHz and 1.75 GHz as these are the specs of the RTL2832U kit).

        My entry into SDR led me to the fascinating work of

        , an intersectional feminist collective, informed by feminist theory and
        speculative storytelling, that uses SDR to collect weather forecasting
        data. On their website, they describe their ethos:

          “In the tradition of intersectional feminism, open-weather
          investigates the politics of location and interlocking oppressions
          that shape our capacities to observe, negotiate, and respond to the
          climate crisis. In doing so, open-weather challenges dominant
          representations of earth and environment while complicating ideas of
          the weather beyond the meteorological.”

          of climate data. Federal agencies such as the National Oceanic and
          Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which monitors the satellites that
          Open Weather track to produce their weather forecasting, have
          restricted or removed entirely access to climate-related datasets for
          scientists and the public. The future of global weather monitoring has
          been thrown into disarray - the administration has already

          By building an archive of DIY weather data collection, similarly to
          Gregory Green’s ‘Gregnik’, more value is placed on community
          knowledge-building over state control. I decided to adopt Open
          Weather’s methodology to build my own DIY satellite ground station. My
          project really took a turn when I was introduced to their methodology,
          as picking up the satellite signals opened up a portal into the cosmic
          soundscape.
