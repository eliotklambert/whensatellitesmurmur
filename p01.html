        While the cosmos has captivated humanity with its elusive expansiveness
        for centuries, it is increasingly becoming a zone of interest for tech
        accelerationism. For centuries, the cosmos has captivated humanity with
        its elusive expansiveness. The cosmos is the passion project of both
        nature enthusiasts and tech accelerationists alike, although it is
        increasingly under threat of attempted colonization and extraction from
        the latter. I write this in the US in 2025, where satellite technology
        has been developed by SpaceX to create a network of global surveillance
        for the US government, under the guise of achieving global connectivity
        for its customers. It seems that the Faustian bargain of this
        information age is hyperconnectivity for the price of surveillance. To
        make matters worse, the new Trump administration is simultaneously
        undermining the use of satellite technology for scientific research; for
        instance, imposing cuts on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration (NOAA) which uses satellites to predict weather data."

        And yet, despite these dismal technopolitics, we are still captivated by
        by the dawn chorus, by mysterious satellite signals, by aerial murmurs
        of both the natural and artificial kind. The ephemerality of our cosmic
        soundscape is a lesson in deep listening, a chance to liberate
        technologies like radio and satellites from their military origins, and
        to repurpose them to celebrate the wonders of the nonhuman world. What
        sonic communication can be imagined between satellites, birds, and
        humans - one of harmony or interference? ‘When Satellites Murmur’ is an
        exploration of the tension between the poetics of cosmic ephemera and
        the politics of technology. The first section of the paper provides
        context for this exploration through the history of satellites, the
        relationship between satellites and their avian counterparts - starlings
        - and the world of deep listening and software defined radio. The second
        section of the paper documents my process of building a network between
        satellites, theremins, and birds for my final installation. This paper
        offers a momentary portal into the weird and wonderful world of the
        cosmos, and its artificial and natural nonhuman networks.
