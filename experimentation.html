      <h1>Part Four - Experimentation</h1>

      <p>
        These stills were taken during my testing of the theremin/satellite
        dish/antenna setup. The first four were taken in my bedroom and roof,
        and the last two were taken in a belltower of a church on a floor that
        was lined with dead pigeons. This process was very experimental and I
        realized that I could play a theremin with an antenna! I also realized
        that playing the theremin as an instrument would be a lot more difficult
        than using it as a midi controller, because I was so new to learning it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="full-indent">
        There was something meditative about this experimental phase, yet also
        frustrating because I had more technical issues and was facing a lot of
        wind, as well as meeting a lot of static when recording (although I got
        used to it). When I had less setup, or when my equipment wasn’t working
        (for example at the church where I only had my antenna unconnected to
        SDR), it was interesting to think more speculatively about what a signal
        could sound like. The act of picking up the NOAA signal is definitely
        more exciting than listening to it without context, so to imagine what
        invisible channels of sound the antennas could pick up, and how the
        signal could be modulated, were both integral parts of my sonic
        modulation.

        This audio-reactive TouchDesigner experiment channels audio from
        CubicSDR into TouchDesigner, where visual noise displacement causes the
        video of a starling murmuration to dissolve into static as the amplitude
        increases. I wanted to explore the idea that the murmuration doesn’t
        just sound like static, but can also be visually transformed into it—as
        thousands of birds become specks of noise on the screen. The murmuration
        is electronically processed.

        The audio in this experiment comes from a website called Radio
        Reference, which lists the

          target="_blank"

          frequencies
        </a>

        of the NYPD communication networks. Inspired by the work of Robin
        ‘Scanner’ Rimbaud, who uses shortwave radio and police scanners to

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXm7b5HIkGQ" target="_blank">
          record
        </a>

        snippets of private conversations, I was drawn to eavesdropping on
        police channels, and was surprised that these channels were openly
        available to anyone with a shortwave radio.

        This experiment was very evocative, and I wanted to incorporate it into
        my sonic network that decided to build on Max MSP instead of
        TouchDesigner, because the former allows for a much wider variety of
        audio parameters than the latter.
