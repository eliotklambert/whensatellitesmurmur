        This sonic network can take on multiple forms. I see this project as a
        series of vignettes instead of a final product. The outcome is different
        each time depending on the radio frequency, the satellite signal, the
        theremin player, and the choice of visuals and prerecorded sound. The
        project can manifest as a video, a performance, and an interactive
        experience. I’m particularly drawn to an interactive setup in which
        participants can control the soundscape through ‘playing’ the theremin.
        From a few demos, I’ve gauged that people are very intrigued and excited
        by the theremin, as it is a pretty rare and unique instrument. However,
        making the installation entirely interactive is risky, as the network is
        technically complex, so if one component gets disconnected then the
        whole network becomes dysfunctional. The ideal setup is a combination of
        fixed video footage and interactive elements, to enter participants into
        the world of these invisible and nonhuman channels of communication.

        For the pop-up show, I will project video footage onto the two satellite
        dishes. One will display a fixed video performance, and the other will
        allow for the participant to modulate the soundscape and sequencing of
        the video through playing the theremin. The interface will be as simple
        as possible, to ensure that the interaction is not too complex to people
        unfamiliar with technology.

        The final pop-up show documentation will be uploaded onto this page of
        the website.
