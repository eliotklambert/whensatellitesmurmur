      <h2>July 2025. SpaceX headquarters. Mr Musk has just unveiled his most ambitious idea yet - Starlink Avian Services, the first satellite service in existence marketed just for birds. Although SpaceX has generated $10 billion in profit in just this year alone, Mr Musk wants to expand the service to an interspecies audience in a connectivity revolution. </h2>
