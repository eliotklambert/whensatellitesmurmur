        Let us begin by delving into the history of satellites as instruments of
        warfare and surveillance. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1,
        the world’s first artificial satellite, equipped with four external
        antennas that transmitted rhythmic radio pulses back to Earth. The
        <a
          href="https://citiesandmemory.com/2019/08/sputnik-historic-beep/"
          target="_blank"
        >
          sound
        </a>
        — short, repetitive beeps — could be picked up across the globe using
        simple shortwave receivers. To the U.S. government, this continuous
        signal represented more than a technical feat; it symbolized a Soviet
        presence that had transcended Earth’s boundaries and entered the realms
        of the cosmic. The resulting wave of alarm became known as the ‘Sputnik
        Crisis.’ That the signal was repetitive, omnipresent, accessible to
        anyone, and immune to jamming made it not just a scientific broadcast,
        but a political act.

        by Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev. Despite its unremarkable size, it
        holds the record as the longest-orbiting satellite in history!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        40 years after Sputnik, Gregory Green responded with
        <a

        , a model replica of Sputnik 1 that was mounted in Williamsburg,
        Brooklyn to broadcast artist-created messages over a low frequency radio
        signal. “It took the entire Soviet state to do Sputnik in 1957,"
        <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/05/gregnik/" target="_blank">
          says Green
        </a>
        ."For some yahoo from Brooklyn to do the same thing 40 years later is to
        redefine our understanding of the individual." The dissemination of
        information is no longer in the hands of the state, but can be mediated
        by individual broadcasters like Green, and more widely recognized,
        revolutionary video artist Nam June Paik.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Paik’s ‘Good Morning Mr Orwell’ was a live satellite television
        broadcast between New York and Paris on New Year’s Day in 1984. The
        piece directly challenged the connotations of satellites as predicted by
        writer George Orwell’s ‘1984’ and actualized by the military and state
        as tools of surveillance. It united a staggering 25 million viewers
        worldwide in a collective watching and listening experience, to
        celebrate the wonders of performance art. My favorite part of the story
        is that the broadcast got progressively more chaotic as the night went
        on, due to delays, interference, the drunkenness of the NYC host George
        Plimpton, and the musician John Cage turning up high to his performance.
        Technically, the show was something of a disaster, but artistically and
        philosophically, it was a masterpiece.

        However, despite these artists challenging the application of satellite
        technology, the reality in 2025 is looking bleak. Starlink, an internet
        constellation company owned by SpaceX, is on a mission to create ‘global
        connectivity’. The phrase sounds tantalizingly utopian, and yet, in this
        era of unprecedented technological oligarchy, it is hard to feel that
        ‘connectivity’ isn’t just a preferential synonym for ‘surveillance’. It
        seems that the faustian bargain of this information age is surveillance
        for the price of connectivity. I imagine the cosmos as a royal court and
        satellites as sycophants, circling around, secretly spying on and
        betraying others. In a contemporary context, Starling satellites act as
        disciples of Elon Musk and SpaceX. In 2021, the National Reconnaissance
        Office (NRO), a US government agency which, according to its website,
        "makes the world a better, safer, stronger place and ensures America
        remains the undisputed leader in space,” contracted SpaceX to build a
        swarm network of hundreds of spy satellites to advance global
        surveillance. On March 16 2024, Reuters

        What is a satellite swarm? It is a formation of synchronized spacecraft
        that follows the rules of natural flocking behavior. Flocking behavior
        has impressed scientists and mathematicians for decades, one of the most
        notable examples being the ‘Boid Algorithm,’ developed by computer
        scientist Craig W. Reynolds in 1987, who writes in his seminal

        </a>
        - ‘Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model’ - “I
        would like to thank flocks. herds. and schools for existing; nature is
        the ultimate source of inspiration for computer graphics and animation.”
        This theoretical model, often used to create simulations, follows three
        rules of movement - separation, to avoid collisions, alignment, to match
        velocity, and cohesion, to avoid predators. Although the model is only
        theoretical, it can be applied to real-life satellite swarm
        configurations, for example Starlink spacecraft, which are programed to
        synchronize data collection, adapt to fast-changing protocols, and avoid
        collisions.

          Project Starling
        </a>
        , a ten-month mission of four satellite spacecraft orbiting as a swarm,
        with the intention that they would communicate autonomously without
        relying on a delayed ground signal. Much like Apple and Amazon, the name
        'Project Starling' implies that communication technology is a natural
        and organic phenomenon. A tactical move, considering starling
        murmurations are one of the most naturally spectacular phenomena on
        planet earth. Satellite swarms, by contrast, have been meticulously
        programmed.

        A murmuration is a swarm of thousands of starlings whose dynamic,
        shape-shifting performance is more than just flocking. They
        paradoxically move unpredictably yet algorithmically. The term
        'murmuration' derives from the distinctive murmuring sound produced by
        the simultaneous flapping of thousands of wings. The collective sound of
        a swarm - as explored by Eugene Thacker in

          'Pulse Demons'

        - is as important as its visual symbolism, if not more so. He writes:

      <br />
      <section class="poem-section">
        <p class="poem-heading">
          “...the problem is that swarms are not only topologically complex, but
          phenomenally complex as well. For example, cicadas constitute a swarm,
          not because of their coordinated, bodily movements, but because of the
          collective sound they produce. In fact, cicadas are more often heard
          than seen – indeed, they are quite impossible to locate by sound. Even
          in cases where swarming is visually present – locusts or large-scale
          starling flocks – the swarm is a massive acoustic event as well.

      <br />
      <p>
        Thacker's insight reveals a deeper connection between sound and swarm
        behavior. The sound of the murmuration - of the flapping of thousands of
        wings - evokes for me something akin to radio static, which is the sonic
        product of electromagnetic interference. In my mind, this brings the
        murmuration closer to the umwelt of the antenna, which operates on
        electromagnetism. The swarm’s movements mirror an algorithmic precision,
        where each bird's motion seems to be calculated to the smallest detail,
        giving the impression of a digital simulation. Thacker’s assertion that
        the swarm is ‘living’ yet separate from the biological or organic realm
        aligns with this interpretation.

        that the government had replaced real birds with drones, is unironically
        coming true. My first thought upon discovering this, besides my fear
        that surveillance capitalism is growing exponentially, was how real
        birds would respond to this fraudster. Would they fear it? Attack it?
        Sing to it? Would they immediately recognize its otherness?

        Whether intentional or unintentional, cases of animals clashing with
        technological systems - such as orcas sinking yachts in southwest
