        <h2>Oh little Sputnik, flying high
          <p>

With made-in-Moscow beep,
<p>
You tell the world it's a Commie sky
<p>
and Uncle Sam's asleep.
<p>
You say on fairway and on rough
<p>
The Kremlin knows it all,
<p>
We hope our golfer knows enough
<p>
To get us on the ball.
<p>
-G. Mennen Williams, the Democratic governor of Michigan, 1957

        In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first artificial satellite - ‘Sputnik 1’ - with four external antennas sending radio pulses back to earth. The <a href="https://citiesandmemory.com/2019/08/sputnik-historic-beep/" target="_blank">sound</a> of its repetitive, short beeps could be picked up all over the world with shortwave receivers, which led to it becoming one of the most iconic sounds in the history of space exploration.
    
        In 1958, NASA was founded in response to the ‘Sputnik crisis’, which sent waves of panic through the US, fuelled by the anxiety that Russia would overtake the US as the leader of space exploration. Satellites therefore have inherently militaristic roots from their application as instruments of surveillance and warfare.

      Now, In 2025, satellite technology is dominated by Starlink, an internet constellation company owned by SpaceX on a mission to create global connectivity. The phrase ‘global connectivity’ sounds tantalizingly utopian, and yet, in this era of unprecedented technological oligarchy under the Trump administration, it is hard to feel hopeful. I imagine the cosmos as a royal court and satellites as sycophants, circling around secretly spying on and betraying others. Like our contemporary context, starlink satellites act as disciples of Elon Musk and SpaceX simply because they are programmed to be. In 2021, the <a href=https://www.nro.gov/National target="_blank" ></a>National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) </a>, a US government agency which, according to its website tagline, "makes the world a better, safer, stronger place and ensures America remains the undisputed leader in space”, contracted SpaceX to build a swarm network of hundreds of spy satellites to advance global surveillance.
