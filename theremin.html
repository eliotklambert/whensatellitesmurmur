      <h1>Process: Part Two - Theremin</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        A theremin is a perfect instrument to interact with celestial bodies -
        such as a satellite or potential ETI - because it operates on
        electromagnetic waves and antennas; it speaks the same language. A
        theremin has two antennas - one for pitch and one for volume - and is
        the only non-contact musical instrument in the world. The player uses
        their body to interfere with the electromagnetic field, which shifts the
        frequency or amplitude of the oscillators. It was invented in 1920 by
        Lev Sergeyevich Termen - better known as Leon Theremin - in a scientific
        laboratory in Soviet Russia.
      </p>

        Similar to the whale sounds picked up by US navy engineer Frank
        Watlington and transformed into a music album by Roger Payne, the
        theremin was a result of Soviet government-funded research into
        proximity sensors - the musical instrument emerged from military
        technology. Allegedly, Vladimir Lenin was so taken by it that Theremin
        was sent on an international tour to show off what is arguably the first
        electronic instrument and a model of successful Soviet technology. The
        story gets better - while Theremin was touring the US, he was engaging
        in industrial espionage for the Soviets, although years later in 1939 he
        returned to Russia and was arrested and sentenced for being
        counterrevolutionary. The tension between sound and music as a product
        of military application is a fascinating motif that I have discovered in
        my research, as explored in earlier anecdotes through Sputnik, the
        chorus waves, the humpback whale, and now, the theremin.

        My favorite example of theremin usage is ‘Teen Age Message’. In 2001,
        led by scientist Alexander L. Zaitsev, a group of teens from the Moscow
        Center of Teen Activity transmitted a theremin concert into the cosmos
        from the Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope, with the hopes of
        communicating with extraterrestrial life through music and art. In his
        proposal to Arecibo Observatory, which was rejected due to a fear of
        making contact with nonhuman (or extraterrestrial) civilizations, he
        writes “I propose not a discrete two-tone radio signal but a more native
        continuous one, in which smooth frequency variations directly transfer
        one-dimensional emotional information. I am talking about music, which
        is more universally comprehensible than language, and about theremin,
        which is an electronic non-contact musical instrument.”

        I have been intrigued and perplexed by the theremin since hearing it
        play unexpectedly at a festival, both for the haunting yet ethereal
        sound it produces, and also the detailed and delicate embodied movement
        it requires from a human player. I created a digital interactive
        theremin on TouchDesigner last year with oscillators and hand tracking,
        which was effective yet ultimately limited to the confines of my laptop
        screen and its hand tracking abilities.

        After doing more research into the world of the theremin, I found the
        opportunity to attend a workshop run by world-renowned thereminist Dorit
        Chrysler, director and co-founder of the NYC Theremin Society.

        I was able to play - for the first time - a physical theremin -
        specifically, a Moog Theremini. It was simultaneously underwhelming and
        overwhelming, for I was not a natural (can anyone be with a theremin
        when it requires you to play in an entirely novel way compared to any
        other instrument?) And yet, I was enchanted by its haunting presence,
        particularly when Dorit played and my whole body vibrated. After the
        workshop, I stayed to chat to her, and I shared my desire to incorporate
        the theremin as part of this cosmic network, to which she told me about
        ‘Electric Storm’, a performance she did at CERN - the European
        Organization for Nuclear Research - home to the biggest machine in the
        world: the Large Hadron Collider. Joe Silva describes ‘Electric Storm’
        as a performance that:
      </p>

      <section class="poem-section">
        <p class="poem-heading">
          “translates the feel of metal, chaos, laboratories, and the sound of
          thousands of voltages used to help cool the colliders, a tiny
          industrial revolution within the factory, capturing conceiving the
          moment of an idea, finally ending in one pure note of the Claravox (a
          type of theremin).”
        </p>

        <p>
          This project is very inspiring in its exploration of the electronic
          interplay between theremin and industrial machine - the coldness of
          the machine contrasts with the sensitivity of the embodied instrument,
          and yet, the theremin can translate the sounds of the machine better
          than a human can.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          After the workshop, I decided it was time to acquire a second-hand
          Moog Theremini, which I leaned towards more than a traditional
          theremin, because I would be able to use it as a midi controller
          connected to a digital interface.
