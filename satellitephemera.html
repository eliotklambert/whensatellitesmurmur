      <h1>Process: Part Three - Satellite Ephemera</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        As most of my experimentation has been conducted on my roof, I have
        become increasingly intrigued by the satellite ephemera that surrounds
        me, particularly the circular dishes that receive radio waves and allow
        me to watch TV. Except I no longer need a satellite dish to stream
        Netflix, so the object has become a relic of a not-so-distant
        technological era - and in doing so, has evoked a sense of nostalgia in
        me. By projecting onto defunct circular satellite dishes, I intend to
        challenge sleek Starlink satellite dishes and their projection of
        accelerationism. Transforming the dish from a functional antenna into a
        screen, I am questioning what satellites are used for, and speculating
        what they could be used for. What if global connectivity was not about
        optimization and surveillance, but about actual, authentic connection
        and meaning-making? Like Zaitsgev’s ‘Teen Age Message’, Green’s
        ‘Gregnik’, or Paik’s ‘Good Morning Mr Orwell’, what if the satellite
        could transcend its functionality to become an art form?
      </p>

      <p>
        I scoured Facebook marketplace for a defunct circular satellite dish,
        and ended up going upstate to pick one up, broken cables and all! The
        commute back to the city was tenuous and I’m glad I got my tetanus shot
        because I scratched my eyebrow with one of the rusty poles.
