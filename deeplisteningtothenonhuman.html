          “Can you imagine listening to all that is sounding as if your body
          were the whole earth? There might be the sounds of your own thoughts
          or of your body, natural sounds of birds or animals, voices, sounds of
          electrical appliances and machines. Some sounds might be very faint,
          some very intense, some continuous, and some intermittent. As you are
          listening globally, can you imagine that you can use any sound that
          you hear as a cue either to relax your body more deeply or to energize
          it?”

          passage
        </a>
        from Pauline Oliveros, a composer and pioneer of deep listening as a
        practice. Deep listening is a call to attention, an act of listening
        that brings heightened awareness to every part of a soundscape, where
        all sounds can be absorbed and embodied. In order to listen, or to
        attempt to listen to nonhuman voices, it is useful to follow this
        practice, to pick up the ephemeral beeps that come and go, to listen to
        the birds.

        <br />
        <br />
        The cosmic soundscape is ephemeral and unpredictable, and has enthralled
        radio enthusiasts and UFO-hunters alike. In

          ‘The Secret Life of Electronic Objects’ </a
        >, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby reflect on the niche subculture of
        ‘whistler hunters’, who:
      </p>
      <br />

      <section class="poem-section">
        <p class="poem-heading">
          “…search out VLF (very low frequency) radio waves or ‘sferics’ short
          for ‘atmospherics’: natural radio-frequency emissions in the
          ionosphere, caused by electromagnetic energy radiated from lightning.
          These signals — resonant clicks and pops called ‘tweaks’ and ‘bonks’
          by scientists — occur in the audible range and may be picked up by
          antennas and amplified for listening. Occasionally sferics get caught
          on, and travel long distances along the magnetic flux lines around the
          earth, producing ‘whistlers’, downward gliding signals which may last
          up to three seconds. These sounds are best received at night, far away
          from power lines and electromagnetic pollution. Whistler hunters
          travel far to unpolluted sites, sometimes camping out for days,
          listening for the elusive sounds of natural radio.
        </p>

        <p class="poem-heading" style="color: blue">
          Although the sounds are fleetingly beautiful, out of context they lose
          much of their charm; their beauty is entwined with the effort endured
          and the symbolic significance of receiving them, which for some is
          quasi-mystical, for others a defiant gesture against people’s careless
          attitude towards nature.”
        </p>
      </section>
      <br />
      <p>
        It seems to ‘whistler hunters’ and other radio amateurs, that the thrill
        in seeking out these sounds is as important as the signal received.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Another example of a mystical cosmic signal is the discovery earlier
        this year that ‘chorus waves’ - a type of ‘whistler’ - are in deep
        space, and sound remarkably like the dawn chorus of birdsong. That they
        have been found in deep space is significant because it suggests they
        can exist anywhere with the semblance of an electromagnetic field - and
        their ability to generate high-energy electrons makes them threatening
        to satellite communication as a source of interference. So, we have a
        whistler that sounds like a bird chirping that can interfere with
        satellite signals - what a network of mimicry!

      <p>
        Chorus waves were discovered back in World War I, when they were
        accidentally picked up by radio operators listening for enemy
        transmissions. A similar example is the now iconic ‘Songs of the
        Humpback Whale’ album by Roger Payne, which used recordings captured by
        a US navy engineer Frank Watlington, who picked up these haunting sounds
        while trying to detect Soviet submarines from a top-secret hydrophone
        station. There is a subversive beauty to the decontextualizing of such
        sounds from their military roots.

        In 1977, the mysterious ‘WOW!’ signal was picked up by Ohio State
        University’s Big Ear radio telescope and lasted 72 seconds. The signal
        was strikingly intense and of a highly specific frequency, leading
        people to speculate that it was an extraterrestrial message. This has
        since been disputed by a more plausible counter theory - that the sound
        came from a hydrogen cloud unpredictably emitting a beam of light.

      <p>
        Regardless, the impact of the Wow! Signal reflects a wider cultural
        fascination with our search for extraterrestrial life. SETI has its
        origins in the pioneering work of astronomer Frank Drake who started
        searching for evidence of alien intelligence back in 1959, through radio
        transmission and reception. In 1974, the first interstellar radio
        transmission into space was sent from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto
        Rico. The transmission was a simple pictogram of a human being and of a
        telescope, composed of binary code. Nadia Drake describes the effect of
        the transmission:
      </p>
      <br />
      <section class="poem-section">
        <p class="poem-heading">
          “Astronomers had already started eavesdropping on the heavens,
          hopefully awaiting murmurs from beyond that would break our seeming
          cosmic solitude. But this was something different - an intentional
          summons, perhaps an invitation for communion with hypothetical beings
          among the stars.”

        ‘The Great Silence’, approaches Arecibo’s search for extraterrestrial
        life from the perspective of a local parrot, who considers the search as
        hypocritical:

      <br />

      <section class="poem-section">
        <p class="poem-heading">
          “The humans use Arecibo to look for extraterrestrial intelligence.
          Their desire to make a connection is so strong that they’ve created an
          ear capable of hearing across the universe. But I and my fellow
          parrots are right here. Why aren’t they interested in listening to our
          voices? We’re a nonhuman species capable of communicating with them.
          Aren’t we exactly what humans are looking for?”
        </p>
      </section>
      <br />

      <p>
        Here lies the contradiction. This search for unknown and distant
        intelligence has always been idealized and mystified, while the natural
        world is taken for granted.

        And yet, there are some humans who listen attentively to the animal
        voice - notably sound ecologist Bernie Krause. His

          album
        </a>

        ‘The Great Animal Orchestra’, is a love letter to biophony, the
        collective sounds of nonhuman organisms sharing the same habitat. He has
        recorded thousands of species from Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe
        to the Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario, and over the years has
        documented the growing silence that has emerged in these natural
        soundscapes as a product of anthropogenic sound.

        Silence is also explored by Rachel Carson in her 1962 book ‘Silent
        Spring’. She

        , “Over increasingly large areas of the United States, spring now comes
        unheralded by the return of birds, and the early mornings are strangely
        silent where once they were filled with the beauty of birdsong.” To her,
        silence is the first indicator of the loss of biodiversity, and she
        blames the impact of human destruction for this loss.

          “What is the radio for?’ The Radio is for taming chicken. It is my
          method for raising chicken. When a chick is born, as soon as it is
          born, we bring a radio and play it at the maximum volume. In this
          manner, the bird becomes accustomed to loud sounds. Even if a car
          makes a sound, the bird will not become excitable. We often leave the
          radio on for seven days.”

        It was written in response to the impact of Israeli occupation on not
        just humans - but birds - in Jawlan, a South Syrian territory. Here the
        anthropogenic sounds are more disruptive than range rovers and alarms -
        they are weapons of mass destruction and their impact is deafening. In
        Western Australia, the lyrebird, an excellent mimicker, has grown so
        accustomed so the melodies of deforestation, that it can imitate a
        chainsaw to an uncanny degree. Human interference disrupts the
        equilibrium of the natural soundscape that has clearly defined channels
        for animal vocalization.

        about these channels - specifically for polyphonic birdsong. She writes
        about how birdsong relates to wider sonic geopolitics, as birds mark
        their territories based on sonic boundaries:
        <br />
      </p>

      <section class="poem-section">
        <p class="poem-heading">
          “As a result of this segmentation into sonic niches, of these
          partitioned voices, through which conflicts linked to acoustic
          territories are settled, the birds’ songs rarely overlap.
          Consequently, they become part of a new system, that of orchestration,
          not only in a strictly musical sense but also in the sense of a social
          musicality. Territories are orchestrations and melodic harmonies.”

          The sound produced is neither cacophonic nor silent, but a coordinated
          chorus that enables birds to sing without signal jamming. Signal
          jamming is the act of a bird interrupting another bird’s song, often
          for the purpose of hijacking a mating call. We can compare signal
          jamming between birds to radio jamming, which is the deliberate
          interference of wireless signals to disrupt information transmission.
          It is achieved by attuning a transmitter to the same frequency of the
          opposing receiver, in order to override the signal. Radio jamming
          (different from interference because it is deliberate) is utilized as
          a form of censorship in totalitarian states and between warring
          countries. In China, it has been reported that shortwave radio
          transmissions of broadcasts such as the Voice of America and Radio
          Free Asia are jammed and replaced by Chinese folk music such as the

          I am fascinated by the politics surrounding signal jamming, both
          between birds and their electronic counterparts - transmitters. I want
          to relish the speculative possibility of birds signal jamming radio
          and satellite communication, even if just for a brief moment, to
          disrupt our human obsession with connectivity, speed, and growth, that
          is epitomized by Starlink.
