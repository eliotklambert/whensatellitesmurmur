          toolkit
        </a>

        to set up the satellite ground station on my roof in Brooklyn, in the
        attempt to pick up and record the signals of NOAA satellites.The toolkit
        teaches you how to set up a DIY satellite ground station to pick up
        signals and collect weather data through sound and image. The first step
        was to buy an SDR kit, which is an antenna connected to an SDR dongle
        that connects to your laptop and

        <a href="https://cubicsdr.com/" target="_blank"> CubicSDR </a>

        . CubicSDR is an open source interface that enables users to explore the
        radio spectrum and demodulate the frequencies that they pick up. All I
        needed to do was set the frequency and desired bandwidth of my intended
        signal, and I could pick up and switch between all kinds of channels,
        from FM radio to morse code. It’s truly an eavesdropper's paradise.

        After connecting my SDR dongle and antenna to my laptop and CubicSDR, I
        was set up to pick up a satellite signal. The toolkit specifies the
        frequencies for the NOAA 15, NOAA 18, and NOAA 19 satellites. Then, I
        looked on this website to find predictions of exactly when each
        satellite would pass over my location, and which passes would be the
        most visible, and therefore the clearest signal to record. The satellite
        passes are around 12 minutes long and are successful if you manage to
        pick up a constant repeated beep.

      <p>
        The challenge of this process is to follow every step exactly - because
        the wrong angle, position, or length of the antenna could impact the
        success of your satellite pickup - which is what happened to me the
        first five times I tried to pick up a signal, and was met with a
        waterfall of static on my screen and through my speakers.

        I got very frustrated when I couldn’t pick up the signal, and wondered
        what I’d done wrong.

        I wrote this poem as a response to my frustration.

        I became desperate to receive a transmission. To find something,
        anything other than static.

      <p>
        After troubleshooting, and perhaps cosmic luck, I finally managed to
        pick up a satellite signal.

      <p>
        The NOAA 15 on April 4th, 2025, at 7.13-7.25PM. The beep was consistent
        and I pointed my antenna to the sky like an outstretched hand.

        The static conceals the aerial view of the clouds and the earth, showing
        just a fragment of familiarity. In a city like NYC, and in most parts of
        the world, it is rare to avoid electromagnetic interference (you need to
        go to

        military).

      <br />
      <p>
        I feel that the visual translation of the static audio encapsulates the
        ephemeral aesthetic of this project. As mentioned earlier, if a
        murmuration can sonically resemble static, then maybe static is just as
        beautiful, just as integral to the narrative, as a signal?
