        London, Bloomsbury, 2021.
      </h2>

      <p>
        This book delves into the invisible networks that shape our lives,
        especially those governed by electromagnetic forces. It introduced me to
        niche subcultures—whistler hunters, electrosensitives, and others whose
        experiences are deeply entangled with electronic technologies. I’m
        especially grateful to Dunne and Raby for their courses Tread Lightly
        and Who Comes After the Human (co-taught by Dominic Pettman), which
        inspired my research into starlings, satellites, and the more than
        human.

      <p>
        Discovering this international feminist community and archive was a
        turning point in my project, as I was able to use their open-source and
        accessible methodology to record satellite signals, enabling me to pick
        up real signals instead of using preexisting recordings.

      </h2>

      <p>
        This project, as well as the documentary ‘The Moon is the Oldest TV’
        about Nam June Paik’s life, inspired me to recontextualize satellites
        and other technology for the purpose of art and poetry, transcending
        their functionality as tools of surveillance and military communication.

        Teen-Age Message Concert. Performed by Lydia Kavina, Yana Aksenova, and
        Anton Kerchenko. Organised by Alexander Zaitsev, August 29 - September
        4, 2001. Yevpatoria Planetary Radar, Yevpatoria, Crimea
      </h2>

      <p>
        Finding out about this concert felt serendipitous - that it was the
        first musical SETI message and they chose to communicate with a theremin
        is so fascinating to me and strengthened my belief that the theremin is
        the best instrument to intercept cosmic signals.

      <p>
        This workshop series was very ear-opening in its exploration of
        interspecies deep listening, positing the question of whether we as
        humans are ready to listen to what other species have to say?

      <p>
        This documentary introduced me to the women who pioneered electronic
        music (in the West). Witnessing the extent of their sonic
        experimentation at a time when electronic composition was not considered
        to be real music was very inspiring.
